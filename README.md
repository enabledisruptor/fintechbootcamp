# Unit 1 Homework Assignment: FinTech Case Study - Financeit

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Financeit. 

* When was the company incorporated?

The company was incorporated in February 1st, 2007.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Michael Garrity, Casper Wong, and Paul Sehr

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The founder and CEO Michael worked in financial services and technology industries building enterprise solutions prior to starting the predecessor of Financeit, Community Lend. He was obsessed with the idea of creating a debt market place where loan seekers are profiled into different risk categories. Once qualified, these multi-purposed loans are syndicated to other individual lenders with varied risk tolerance who want to participate, similar to a mini version of securitization seen in PE and IB. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Financeit is currently in its venture round of funding, most recently funded by Goldman Sachs as its lead investor, having raised $61.4MM in total throughout seed, angel, series A and B. 


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Financeit focuses on PoS lending with an application framework that allows merchants predominantly in the home services business to be able to present and articulate quotes to clients as affordable monthly payments instead of a huge lump sum figure. The fintech company is partially a lender and partially a sales enablement tool used by wide range of customers, from small home services merchants that leverage Financeit to close more deals (without having to host the lending/finance infrastructure themselves) to large home retailer clients like Home Depot (Project Loan) that requires deep integration of core systems and payment processing capabilities to improve customer experience and their respective purchasing power. As both a software company and a lender, Financeit operates under the guidance of regulatory compliance/restriction while optimizing user interface design for multiple stakeholders. 
 
 * Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Michael and his team aims to look for transactions that are tremendously under-facilitated, and ultimately concluded that credit sales for home improvement was a gigantic market and severely underserved. According to Statistica forecast, the home improvement industry sales in Canada was 52.6B and projected to reach 56.3B by 2022. 
 
 * What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Since Michael and his team did such a good job in identifying the niche market in providing loans specifically tailored to SMBs and contractors in home improvement services as well as customers who are looking for this service, they do not currently have any direct competitors. However, there are still alot of fintech companies in alt lending space. In addition, they will face immense pressure as big tech firms like Shopify and Amazon who are looking to enter the consumer and SMB lending space will likely be their biggest threat. Since they have already acquired valuable real-time financial data from these companies through their platform, offering tailored lending solutions to their existing customers will inherently have no customer acquisition cost. The competitive advantage they possess is the partnership with giant brick and mortar chains like HomeDepot. They offer financing with direct access to HomeDepot client base with Financeit/HomeDepot credit cards and financing programs that allows them to lower their customer acquisition cost drastically as to a new entrant startup. As mentioned prior, the ability to function as a credit lending without the need to host expensive infrastructure is their utmost competitive advantage against other fintech in the SMB lending space. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?

In terms of their tech stack, they are using multiple products and services for different functions. For Ad Tech, they are using AdRoll and Signal. For analytics and business intelligence, they are using Heap, Optimizely, Matomo, Google Analytics. For CMS, they rely on WordPress, LiveJounal, Vimeo, and Gravatar. For digital marketing, they are using Goggle Tag Manager and Adobe Activation. For email hosting and other hosting capabilities, they are using Gsuite, Amazon Route. For languages and frameworks, they are using HTML 5 and PHP. For security, they are using reCAPTCHA. For software development, they are using jQuery, Bootstrap. Finally, for user engagement, they are using SurveyMonkey predominately. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Consumer & SME Lending & Mobile Payments

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

As mentioned prior, big techs are looking to enter into this space. Incumbents are also heavily invested in terms of innovation in order to avoid losing market share in this domain to the FinTech companies. Of course, the pandemic has significantly accelerated digital transforation in banks' lending platforms, with more now using advanced tech for onboarding and loan management. Government subsidizing programs during COVID have enabled many incumbents and fintechs to established new relationships with many SMEs. The challenge now is how to deepen these relationships to drive profitability for both banks and disruptors. AI and big data analysis have the opportunity to do just that where fintechs and banks can gain greater insight into consumer and SME transaction behaviour and customer needs in order for them to tailor and create incentivizing products and create a competitive and innovative lending market for customers. However, at least for Canada, this also pressures the regulators to embrace open banking by focusing on regtech innovation in order to keep up with the demand for open banking and safeguard consumer interest from a security and risk perspective.  

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

Borrowell, FundThrough, Progressa, Nesto, Lending Loop, and other fintech firms who has a digital presence in alt lending space in Canada. Since Financeit does not participate in lending in the states due to the ghettoization of the lending space (multiple different zones within a city with drastic credit performances) it is hard for financeit to establish a credit model there. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

So far, Financeit has partnered with over 8,000 businesses to process more than 5BB in loan applications. For some businesses, the loan approval process took less than one day, allowing business to fulfill their finance needs almost immediately to avoid funding gaps which can sometime be a detriment to operations and client experience. They also offer in-house marketing support for their SMB customers to make their own sales process more effective. Their business was especially impactful during COVID when contractors were looking for financing for their customers for home improvement project as everyone was staying home during lockdown. They played a key role in SMB revitalization post lockdown when businesses were dealing with cashflow issues. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

The financial KPIs for fintechs are mostly ambiguous as many are not yet public and financial performance except for bottomline estimates are not available. Metrics such as OCF, burn rate, and gross profit margin are not available. Moreover, most fintech firms like Financeit are still at their growth stage and financial assessment should be taken with a grain of salt. In terms of customer and marketing metrics, the total downloads last 30 days were 225 which is down -25.99%. Although it seems like a significant decrease, we should be aware that since Financeit predominately targets the home improvement sector in Canada, download growth will bound decline eventually as total download reaches a certain threshold within this market as the Canadian market is substantially smaller than countries like the U.S. If this was at the early stage of the company going through seed rounds and series A, I would be worried if the download growth declines. However, they are in the late stage of their funding and their customer base has already been established, fluctuation within this KPI is within reason. Another KPI I was able to find is their monthly visit growth on their website which is currently at 32.44%. Although it seems impressive, their ranking amongst all fintech firms have declined from the previous month. However, their visit duration growth has seen a whopping 2872.73% from the previous month. This could mean that although the number of visiters of their APP and website have declined, whoever stayed are actually engaged enough to spend time reading about their product. Their bounce rate is currently sitting at 73% which is considerably high on the surface but compared to other similar companies, it is actually slightly below average.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Financeit is able to underwrite much more loans using their own version of credit model compared to other fintech firms and incumbents. Michael stated that FinanceIt’s mode is built on 50 years worth of data and data tends. It began with a heavy reliance on the traditional credit score and, over time, evolved to include different nuances and insights that helped Michael and his team build proprietary theorems for their credit model. The key factors of the credit model involve: Who is this person? What are they doing with their credit? What is their credit score? What’s their capacity to pay? This underlying case centric approach allowed them to achieve 70MM in topline this year, 0.5BB in lending, and 2BB sales activity in its software business in the US. Which is what attracted Goldman Sachs attention as a financial backer. Compared to their competitors like fundthrough who has 120MM funding but is only doing 10MM topline vs a 70MM with a 60MM Funding for Financeit, I'd say they are killing it. Although, FundThrough and other companies started much, Michael started his business right before the financial crisis and gained valuable experience of operating through a credit crisis while in the lending space, and spent sufficient time to find the niche market and product market fit for his software product to out compete others in the industry.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Currently,  Financeit has further expanded their market beyond home services to public sector sustainability infrastructure (provincial government in BC & NS) primarily because their business model & products allow customers in different industries to accomplish their own agenda. However, I believe the biggest advantage they have is data and relationship built with several retail contractors and vendors. Relationships with large brick-and-mortar chains like HomeDepot has also propelled them into the leading position within this niche market. If anything I believe they should leverage data collected from all their existing deals and relationships with different stakeholders to create a marketplace platform for home improvement industry overall to solidify their monopoly in this segment of the market. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

First, Financeit have essentially 0 CAC cost, as contractors who uses their software will automatically retrieve consumer financial data for them. Since their business model strives on the self-interest of the contractors to leverage their services in order to increase sales, they obtain data and valuable insights for free as long as they retain their client base in contractors. Deepeninng customer relationships for both contractors and their respective clients require large amount of data analysis for not only business development but also improvement on their current credit model to better underwriting procedure and create more lending opportunities otherwise not possible without data as a B2B2C company. Thus, this syncranization cycle between all stakeholders gives them the red carpet to do a reversal strategy of some of the big techs today. Amazon and Shopify have the platform for vendors (in our case contractors) to sell their products/services, but are looking to enter the fintech game. Financeit having obtained the trust and relationship through fintech now has the opportunity to create a marketplace platform within the home improvement and sustainability projects segment.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

UX design softwares, HTML 5, Python, NoSQL Database, Data Lakes, Quandl

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

UX design softwares like HTML 5 to used for CMS, and the others are for data analytics as well as their current programs mentioned in previous section to enhance their data analytics capabilities. Currently they already have 21 IPs registered, should leverage these programs to potentially create more (another strategic direction they could go, but far-fetched)
